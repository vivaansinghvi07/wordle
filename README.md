# Wordle
A console-playable version of the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)!

## Features
- Alphabet at the top of the screen, displaying (or hiding) the letters depending on if it was correctly, partially correctly, or incorrectly guessed.
- Colored letters as it is done in the official game.
- Dictionary to make sure inputted words are real words.
- Error message displaying if word not proper.

## To Play
Simply run the Java program, and you're good to go! Upon starting, the game will prompt you for your first move. It will look something like this 

```
